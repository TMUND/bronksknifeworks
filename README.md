Redesign of knife website for Lyle B.

# TODO:

* Style pages (currently only there for example)
* Create further functionality and working links
* Integrate all photos into picture slider
* Tighten up slider on photos page
* Update "Full Screen" button to change to "sidebar" when clicked
* Create contact form in page that routes emails to Lyle

## Later:

* Integrate some type of e-commerce plugin that will allow storage of purchase/shipping information
