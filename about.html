                        <h1>Who am I?</h1>
                        <p> Hi I'm Lyle Brunckhorst, I'm a long term member of the ever growing community of custom knife makers but I have developed my own styles and patterns of stainless steel stock removal hunting knives, pocket knives and other custom knives over the years and some of my knives are still traced from these time tested patterns. As I expand into more the forged blade and building my own Damascus steel patterns, I favor the one of a kind type of knife, as it gives me more artistic liberty.<br><br>

                         I believe in customer satisfaction and my knives come with a lifetime guarantee. However, I do not warranty against abuse of the knife and I have no power over natural materials and their instability to environmental changes. If a problem or defect should arise, I will fix or replace it at my discretion.<br><br>

                        Almost from the beginning of my career as one of these custom knife makers, I have been sharpening knives for the local folks and have gotten quite proficient at it. I now have a steady income of knife sharpening that helps to finance bigger and better ventures such as an occasional dagger or Bowie knife. Another one of those projects is the Northwest Hammer In. I have been lucky enough to get some top talent to the seminars and have had a lot of fun helping to advance the art.<br><br>

                        One of the most rewarding things that I have ever done is make custom knives, but it doesn't hold a candle to the feeling I get teaching the craft. I started teaching knife making under the name "Northwest School of Knifemaking" a few years back and it has been the best venture of my life. The great reward is watching someone as they pass the ABS style test with their newly forged blade and joining the ranks of the custom knife makers. I'm a Montana native and I made my first knife back in 1976 when I was living in White Sulphur Springs, Montana. At the time I was an avid hunter and spent most of my time in the great outdoors. I tested my hunting knives in the hunting camps and have had many very satisfied customers, some of them outfitters.<br><br>
